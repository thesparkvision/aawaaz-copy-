/// Comprehensive quality regression tests for the full text cleanup pipeline.
///
/// Runs ~100 test cases through deterministic self-correction → filler removal → LLM cleanup,
/// printing a debug trace at each stage. Used to establish a baseline and validate every
/// subsequent change in the quality & speed improvement plan.
///
/// **These tests are opt-in** — they require the LLM model to be downloaded and take
/// significant time to run. Enable via environment variable or UserDefaults.
///
/// **From Xcode:**
///   1. Edit the Aawaaz scheme → Test → select the Aawaaz test plan
///   2. Click the ⓘ next to the test plan → Configurations → Default
///   3. Under Environment Variables, enable `RUN_QUALITY_TESTS`
///   4. Run the CleanupQualityTests test class from the Test navigator
///
/// **From CLI:**
///   ```
///   defaults write dev.shantanugoel.Aawaaz RUN_QUALITY_TESTS -bool YES
///   cd Aawaaz && xcodebuild test -project Aawaaz.xcodeproj -scheme Aawaaz \
