# Aawaaz - Product Specification

## Overview

Aawaaz (आवाज़ — "voice" in Hindi) is a system-wide, real-time, fully local voice-to-text dictation app for macOS. It enables users to speak in any application and have their speech transcribed and inserted at the cursor — similar to WisprFlow, but with full privacy (no cloud dependency), multi-lingual support, and first-class Hindi-English (Hinglish) code-switching.

## Target Platform

- macOS on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- Intel Macs are explicitly out of scope
- iOS port is a future goal (shared SwiftUI views + AVAudioEngine code)
- Android is not planned

## Core Value Proposition

1. **Fully local** — All transcription happens on-device. No audio ever leaves the machine. Privacy by default.
2. **System-wide** — Works in any app (Slack, VS Code, browser, Notes, Terminal, etc.) using the most reliable available insertion path, with macOS Accessibility as the default starting point.
3. **Hinglish-native** — First-class support for Hindi-English code-switching (speaking Hindi mixed with English words mid-sentence).
4. **Fast** — Targets a competitive, WisprFlow-like experience for short phrases, with implementation details and latency trade-offs validated on real Apple Silicon hardware.
5. **Beautiful & minimal** — Small floating overlay + menu bar presence. Stays out of the way.

## Implementation Notes

- This specification defines product requirements and UX goals, not a mandate to use one specific macOS API everywhere.
- Where concrete implementation examples are given below (hotkeys, Accessibility insertion, streaming strategy), treat them as likely starting points that must still be validated against real app compatibility, permission behavior, and measured latency.
- If implementation evidence shows a named approach is insufficient, prefer changing the implementation approach over weakening the product outcome.

## User Experience

### Activation Flow

1. User presses a configurable global hotkey (examples: hold-to-talk or toggle-based shortcuts; the exact default should be chosen only after validating reliability and conflict rate on macOS)
2. A small floating overlay appears near the cursor/focused text field, showing a recording indicator
3. User speaks naturally (in English, Hindi, or mixed Hinglish)
4. Interim transcription or other live feedback appears in the overlay while speech is being processed, as allowed by the chosen latency/accuracy strategy
5. On release of hotkey (or silence timeout), final transcription is inserted into the focused text field
6. Overlay dismisses

### Two Activation Modes

- **Hold-to-talk**: Hold the hotkey while speaking. Release to finish. Best for short dictation.
- **Toggle mode**: Press hotkey to start, press again to stop. Best for longer dictation.

### Menu Bar App

- Lives in macOS menu bar (no dock icon)
- Popover shows:
  - Current status (idle / listening / processing)
  - Selected model (turbo / large-v3 / custom)
  - Selected language mode (Auto / English / Hindi / Hinglish)
  - Quick access to settings
- Runs as a background process (LSUIElement)

### Settings

- **Model selection**: Choose between downloaded models (turbo, large-v3, etc.) with size/speed/accuracy trade-off displayed
- **Model management**: Download, delete, and update GGML models
- **Language mode**: Auto-detect (default), force English, force Hindi, or Hinglish-optimized
- **Hotkey configuration**: Choose activation key and mode (hold vs. toggle)
- **LLM post-processing**: Off / Local (Phi-3.5-mini or Llama 3.2 3B) / Remote (Claude API / OpenAI API)
- **LLM cleanup level**: Light (filler words only) / Medium (+ grammar) / Full (+ context-aware formatting)
- **Latency vs. accuracy**: Slider or presets (Fast/Balanced/Quality) that adjust chunk size and model
- **Text insertion method**: Auto / AX API / Keystroke simulation / Clipboard
- **Audio input**: Select microphone device

## Transcription Engine

### Primary: whisper.cpp

- C/C++ Whisper implementation optimized for Apple Silicon
- Metal GPU acceleration for encoder
- Optional CoreML acceleration for Apple Neural Engine
- GGML quantized models (Q5_0 for best size/quality trade-off)
- No language parameter by default for best code-switching behavior

### Models (user-downloadable)

| Model | Download Size | RAM Usage | Speed (M2, 1min) | Hinglish Quality | Recommended For |
|-------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| small | ~181 MB | ~1 GB | ~3s | Marginal | Low-RAM machines, quick notes |
| turbo | ~600 MB | ~2.5 GB | ~4s | Good | **Default — best trade-off** |
| large-v3 | ~1.1 GB | ~4 GB | ~8s (Metal) | Best | Quality mode, important dictation |
| indicwhisper* | TBD | TBD | TBD | Potentially best | Hinglish-optimized (if GGML conversion works) |

*IndicWhisper models from AI4Bharat, pending GGML format conversion and benchmarking.

### Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

- Silero VAD (~2 MB model)
- Runs on every 30ms audio frame
- Detects speech start/end boundaries
- Prevents Whisper hallucinations on silence
- Configurable speech padding (default: 300ms after speech ends)

### Streaming Architecture

The exact implementation can range from VAD-segmented final inference to more streaming-oriented interim inference. The chosen approach should be driven by measured latency and perceived UX quality, not by attachment to a single pipeline shape.

```
Microphone (AVAudioEngine, 16kHz mono)
    │
    ▼
Silero VAD (per 30ms frame)
    │
    ├── No speech → discard, continue
    │
    └── Speech detected → buffer audio
            │
            ├── Speech ongoing → continue buffering
            │                    (optionally run interim inference every N seconds)
            │
            └── Speech ended (+ padding) → send buffer to whisper.cpp
                    │
                    ▼
              whisper.cpp inference (Metal GPU)
                    │
                    ▼
              Raw transcription text
                    │
                    ▼
              [Optional] LLM post-processing
                    │
                    ▼
              Insert text into focused app
```

### Latency Budget (turbo model, M2+)

This is a target envelope, not a guarantee. It should be validated early on representative Apple Silicon hardware. If the measured experience is not competitive enough, interim inference or other latency reductions should move earlier in the roadmap.

| Stage | Time |
|-------|------|
| VAD speech-end detection + padding | ~300ms |
| whisper.cpp inference (turbo, Metal) | ~2-4s for typical utterance |
| LLM cleanup (if enabled, local) | ~1-2s |
| Text insertion (AX API) | ~10ms |
| **Total without LLM** | **~2.5-4.5s** |
| **Total with local LLM** | **~4-7s** |

## LLM Post-Processing

### Purpose

- Remove filler words ("um", "uh", "so like", "basically")
- Fix grammar and punctuation
- Context-aware formatting (Markdown in code editors, casual in chat apps, formal in email)
- Handle Hinglish romanization preferences (user may prefer "kaise ho" vs "कैसे हो")

### Local LLM Options

| Model | Size (Q4) | RAM | Speed | Quality |
|-------|-----------|-----|-------|---------|
| Phi-3.5-mini (3.8B) | ~2.2 GB | ~3 GB | ~1-2s | Good for cleanup tasks |
| Llama 3.2 3B | ~1.8 GB | ~2.5 GB | ~1-2s | Good general purpose |
| Gemma 2 2B | ~1.5 GB | ~2 GB | ~1s | Lighter, decent quality |

### Remote LLM Options

- Claude API (Haiku for speed, Sonnet for quality)
- OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini for speed)
- User provides their own API key in settings

### Memory Management

- LLM model is lazy-loaded (only when post-processing is enabled)
- Can be unloaded to free RAM
- Whisper and LLM can coexist on 16GB+ machines (~6-8 GB total)
- On 8GB machines, recommend smaller Whisper model + smaller LLM, or disable LLM

## Text Insertion

### Primary: Accessibility API (AXUIElement)

Accessibility should be the default insertion path when it works well, but "system-wide" support should be interpreted as "use the most reliable insertion strategy per app," not "force one AX mutation path everywhere."

1. Get the frontmost application via `NSWorkspace.shared.frontmostApplication`
2. Get the AX application element via `AXUIElementCreateApplication(pid)`
3. Find the focused UI element via `kAXFocusedUIElementAttribute`
4. Verify the element is actually editable/settable for the current app
5. Get current value and selection range where available
6. Insert transcription at the cursor using the least-destructive strategy that works for that app/element (for example selected-text replacement, direct AX mutation, or a validated fallback)

### Fallback: Keystroke Simulation

For apps that don't properly expose usable AX text elements (some Electron apps, games, terminals, or custom editors), paste-based or synthesized-keystroke fallback may be more reliable than direct AX mutation:
1. Copy transcription to clipboard
2. Simulate Cmd+V keystroke via `CGEventPost`

### Fallback: Clipboard Only

If both methods fail, copy to clipboard and show a notification.

### Permissions Required

- **Microphone**: Requested via standard macOS permission dialog
- **Accessibility**: User must manually enable in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
- App should guide user through this on first launch with clear instructions

## Voice Commands (Future Phase)

### Pattern-Matched Commands (Phase 4a)

Detect keywords in transcription and execute actions instead of inserting text:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| "delete that" / "undo that" | Cmd+Z |
| "new line" / "next line" | Insert newline |
| "new paragraph" | Insert double newline |
| "select all" | Cmd+A |
| "copy that" | Cmd+C |
| "period" / "comma" / "question mark" | Insert punctuation |
| "stop dictation" | Deactivate |

### LLM-Interpreted Commands (Phase 4b)

Pass transcription through LLM with instruction to detect commands:
- "Move that paragraph up"
- "Change the email to john@example.com"
- "Make the last sentence more formal"
- "Read that back to me" (future: TTS integration)

## Multi-Language Support

### Independent Languages

Whisper turbo/large-v3 supports 99 languages. Users select their language in settings, or use auto-detect mode. No special work needed beyond exposing the language selector.

### Code-Switching Pairs

| Priority | Pair | Approach |
|----------|------|----------|
| P0 | Hindi-English (Hinglish) | Whisper auto-detect + IndicWhisper fine-tuned models |
| P1 | Tamil-English | IndicWhisper models |
| P1 | Punjabi-English | IndicWhisper models (limited) |
| P2 | Spanish-English | Whisper auto-detect (works reasonably well) |
| P2 | French-English | Whisper auto-detect |
| P3 | Other Indian languages | AI4Bharat ecosystem |
| P3 | Other pairs | Custom fine-tuning (LoRA on Whisper) |

### Hinglish-Specific Considerations

- Whisper may output Devanagari script for Hindi portions — user should be able to configure preference (Devanagari vs. romanized)
- LLM post-processing can handle script normalization
- Common Hinglish patterns: English technical terms in Hindi sentences, Hindi colloquialisms in English sentences
- Test with representative speakers — Hinglish varies significantly by region and speaker

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- App launch to ready: < 3 seconds (model pre-loaded)
- Hotkey to listening: < 100ms
- End-of-speech to text inserted: < 5 seconds (turbo, no LLM)
- Idle CPU usage: < 1% (VAD only runs during active listening)
- Idle RAM: ~50-100 MB (app only, models loaded on demand or kept resident per user preference)

### Reliability

- Graceful handling of model loading failures
- Fallback text insertion methods
- Crash recovery (save last transcription)
- Audio device hot-swap support (e.g., switching headsets)

### Privacy

- Zero network calls in default configuration (no telemetry, no cloud)
- Remote LLM is opt-in only with clear indication
- No audio stored to disk (unless user explicitly enables transcription history)
- Optional: encrypted local transcription history

### Accessibility

- VoiceOver compatible settings UI
- High contrast overlay option
- Configurable overlay size and position

## Out of Scope (for now)

- Speaker diarization (who said what)
- Audio file transcription (only live microphone)
- Real-time translation
- Text-to-speech
- Windows/Linux support
- Collaboration/sharing features
- Built-in fine-tuning UI
